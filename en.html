                        My name is <b>Wojciech Wrobel</b>. I am a resident of Wrocław, born in 1988, and I cannot imagine living and working elsewhere. A few years ago I fell in love with Georgia. 
                        I am still getting to know its culture, traditions and fascinating, friendly inhabitants. Since 2019, I am honored to be the Honorary Consul of Georgia in Wrocław.
                        <p></p><b>Education and activity</b>
                        I graduated in psychology at the SWPS University and, with honors, Master of Business Administration studies at the Wrocław University of Technology and Central 
                        Connecticut State University. I am a co-founder and vice-president of the WUST MBA graduate association - Business Club B4. I am honored to be a lifetime member of 
                        the Council of the College of Eastern Europe Jan Nowak-Jeziorański, whose mission is to work to build Eastern Europe as a community of free people. I am in the 
                        chapter of the Tytus Filipowicz, awarded to citizens of Caucasian countries, incl. for the development of science and culture and building a civil society. 
                        I am a member of the Program Council of the G2 Forum - Economy and Geopolitics, in which we set the goals and priorities of the Institute of Economic and 
                        Geopolitical Strategies. I am a co-founder of the <a href="https://instytut-heweliusza.pl/" target="blank"><b>Heweliusz Institute</b></a>, where we deal with broadly understood education in the field of management, economics, 
                        law and psychology, as well as raising the competences of people managing local government units and enterprises.
                        <p></p>
                       
                        I am particularly close to the subject of family businesses. I share my experience in this area during business conferences and lectures for students who study economics.
                        I conduct classes on the principles of functioning of family businesses and international economic cooperation at the Study of Eastern Europe at the University of Warsaw.
                        I belong to the association The Family Business Network Poland (FBN Poland), which works for family businesses. 
 
                        <p></p>For several years I have been involved in social and philanthropic activities.
                        <p></p><b>We run a family business</b>
                        <p></p>
                        I am the owner of Grupa Wróbel, a family company that would not exist if not for my late father Mirosław. 
                        He started at the beginning of the 90s in a small car repair shop in Wrocław's Maślice, but he had ambitious plans which he consistently implemented step by step. 
                        At work, I am also inspired by my mother Jolanta, who contributed to building the success of our company. 
                        We are currently one of the largest automotive companies in Poland and a dealer for Mercedes-Benz and Mazda. 
                        In 2018, we were on the list of the 200 Largest Polish Companies in the "Wprost" ranking and Polish Business Ambassadors for 2017.

                        The consular district covers the Lower Silesian Voivodeship, but since Georgia in Poland only has an embassy in Warsaw,

                        <hr class="divider my-4">
                      </div>
                      <p>Business contacts between Lower Silesia and Georgia are my priority. 
                        We already have great friendly and local government relations, now it's time for business. 
                        I want Wrocław and Lower Silesian companies to be present in the South Caucasus. 
                        This region is extremely attractive and creates new business prospects. 
                        Lower Silesian entrepreneurs and local government officials who have been traveling to Georgia on economic missions for 
                        several years are well aware of this.</p>

                      <p><b>This business pays off</b></p>

                      <p>Annually, 9 million tourists come to Georgia, which is over twice as many as this country’s citizens. 
                        The real estate market is developing well, especially those intended for rent, but not only that, for example, 
                        a hotel investment can pay for itself even in 3.5 years. It all shows that the market is incredibly absorbent and prospective. 
                        The citizens of Turkey and Russia, and more and more often the British, are active there. 
                        Georgians, however, are also interested in cooperation with Poles. 
                        It is important for our entrepreneurs to see this opportunity, 
                        and I would like them to be companies from Wrocław and our region. </p>

                      <p><b>A chance for Lower Silesian companies</b></p>

                      <p>Due to its location, Georgia is a kind of communication hub, as it ensures connectivity between West Asia, Central Asia and Europe. 
                        Through Georgia, Polish goods and services have easier access to the markets of the South Caucasus, including Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kazakhstan, 
                        as well as Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia.</p> 

                      <p>Georgians want to cooperate with Lower Silesian companies, especially from the IT, construction, energy and tourism sectors. 
                        Infrastructure investments have good prospects, a lot is being built and modernized there, e.g. roads, sports facilities or hydroelectric plants, 
                        heavy industry and mining are developing (Georgia obtains significant amounts of manganese ore). 
                        Lower Silesian companies that cooperate with <a href="https://kghm.com/" target="blank">KGHM</a> can find partners in Georgia. </p>

                      <p><b>Running a business and taxes</b></p>

                      <p>Georgia has a very well-educated workforce. All costs related to employment are tax in the amount of 20%. For comparison - in Poland it is about 50 percent. 
                        In Georgia, the Estonian tax method is used, i.e. a company that generates income until it consumes profits in the form of dividends, does not pay taxes.</p>

                      <p>According to the Doing Business report, Georgia is among the top 10 countries to run their own business.
                        It is a country open to investment. This is facilitated by simplified economic law, e.g. a company can be registered and opened in one day. 
                        Many mandatory licenses and permits have been abolished. Customs clearance times have been reduced. Interestingly, in Georgia, social benefits are financed by the state.
                         Therefore, the entrepreneur does not have to pay contributions related to the employment of the employees.</p>

                      <p><b>Georgia - European Union</b></p>

                      <p>Georgia is striving for membership in the European Union and NATO, which is of the key importance for business and tourist contacts.</p> 
                      <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: circle;">On March 28, 2017, the EU introduced visa liberalization and from that day 
                          Georgian citizens have been able to travel to European Union countries without visas - up to 90 days in six months. 
                          Earlier, in 2011, the EU-Georgia agreements on visa facilitation and readmission entered into force. Importantly, 
                          Poles, regardless of the destination, can enter Georgia without visas, and when crossing the border, 
                          you must show a passport or ID card.</li>

                        <li style="list-style-type: circle;">As of 1 July 2016, the EU-Georgia Association Agreement, including the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, is fully in force.</li>

                        <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Since 2009, Georgia has been a member of the Eastern Partnership, which is to deepen political ties and economic integration of 
                          the European Union with six partner countries of Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus. This group, apart from Georgia, includes Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,

                      <p><b>It's worth going to Georgia</b></p>

                        <p>For me, Georgia is tradition, modernity and hospitality, which is the best of the Caucasus. I’m still getting to know Georgia and I still haven’t had enough of it; it's beautiful mountains, warm sea, ancient monuments, great cuisine and highly valued wines. Annually, 9 million tourists come to Georgia, which is over twice as many as there are inhabitants there. Among all European Union countries, Poles visit Georgia most often.
                        </p>

                      <p><b>Going skiing in winter, on the Black Sea Riviera in summer?</b></p>

                        <p>WWhy not? There are nearly 3,000 km from Wrocław to Georgia, but we have a direct air connection from Wrocław to Kutaisi, where the flight time is less than 3.5 hours. There are also flights from Katowice, Kraków, Gdańsk and Warsaw.
                        </p>

                        <p>Georgia and the Caucasus may be an alternative to the Alps, especially as they have their own five-thousanders. In addition, it is definitely cheaper there, even five times compared to the offer in Europe. The standards are good: I drove there, checked and left satisfied. And Batumi on the Georgian Riviera needs no introduction, it is the hottest Black Sea resort.
                        </p>  

                        <p>In this small country, you can find ancient cities, castles and temples. Less than three hours is enough to get from Tbilisi to Dawit Gareja, where there is a 
                          complex of monasteries from the beginning of Christianity.</p>

                        <p>In Georgia, you can try delicious cuisine and more and more valued wines and liqueurs. So important on the wine map of the world that enotourism has become a separate branch of the tourist business. Georgians have unique landscapes for paragliding and horseback riding, which is also popular.</p>

                      <p><b>Security/insurance </b></p> 

                        <p>Poles leaving for Georgia are asking about security, because a decade ago there was a war with separatists from Ossetia and Russia. The conflict was brief and it is really safe there now. If it wasn’t safe, tourists from all over the world would not go there. According to the Crime Index by Country, Georgia is considered one of the safest countries in the world.</p>

                      <p><b>Visa</b></p>

                      <p>When traveling, Poles do not need a visa. We can fly there with just a passport or ID card.</p>

                      <p><b>Insurance</b></p>

                      <p>The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs absolutely recommends having travel insurance for the amount of at least PLN 30,000. euro, covering the costs of treatment and transport of the patient to Poland. If it is necessary to use health care, it is expected that the bills will be settled on the spot or the data of the insurer will be transferred. People planning mountain trips should have a special type of insurance that covers the costs of rescue operations in the mountains.</p>

                      <p><b>Health</b></p>

                      <p>
                        No vaccinations for travelers are required in Georgia. Medical care for tourists is fully paid. Private medical clinics are open in Tbilisi and larger cities
                         (hospitalization is possible). A visit to a private clinic is the equivalent of 30-40 euro. </p>

                      </div>
                      <p><b>Georgia - what is worth and should know - the Georgian alphabet of Wojciech Wróbel</b></p>
                      <p><b>Georgia has to be felt, tried and experienced. If we do this, I guarantee that you will fall in love for life.
                        To bring this country closer, here is my Georgian alphabet.</b></p>

                      <p></p><b>A</b> –  like the alphabet, i.e. ქართული ანბანი, because the Georgian alphabet is unique.It’s the reason for Georgians to be proud of. Its history dates back to the 3rd century BC. It is on the UNESCO list and is one of the 14 alphabets in the world. It has 33 letters, but no capital letters or punctuation marks. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that it has always been and still is is used only by Georgians.
                      <p></p><b>B</b> – like Batumi. The hottest Black Sea resort. One of the oldest cities in Georgia and the capital of the autonomous republic of Adjara, called the Caucasian Dubai. The city and its "tea fields and cicadas ringing dawn" are known to Poles from the song of the Philippines from the 1960s. On July 17, 2019, in the Alphabetic Tower in Batumi, the mayor of Wrocław Jacek Sutryk and the president of Batumi Lasha Komakhidze signed an agreement on partnership cooperation between the two cities.
                      <p></p><b>Ch</b> – like christianity. Georgians emphasize that they are the second Christian country in the world, after Armenia. They like to tell tourists that they were Christians right after Christ. When someone asks, "But wait a minute, what about the Armenians?", They reply, "Armenians were Christians before Christ." For Georgians, Christianity is culture, tradition and folklore. On the other hand, Poles most often associate the famous ballet and traditional choirs with Georgian culture.
                      <p></p><b>D</b> – like pride. It is a very proud nation. They are proud of what they have: the alphabet, wine, dishes. They are proud of the history that they have gone through so much, and they still speak and write using Georgian rather than Cyrillic. Their Church is called Ecclesia, not the Church. They are proud when they say Saqartvelo, not Georgia, because the origin of word "Georgia" comes from Russia for them.
                      <p></p><b>E</b> – like elarji.A delicious Megrelian dish, it is made of melted sulguni cheese, which is a bit like Italian mozzarella. It is eaten warm, you can eat it with corn grits.
                      <p></p><b>F</b> – like ... this letter is not in the Georgian alphabet, but it is worth remembering Tytus Filipowicz in the context of Polish-Georgian relations. It was the first Polish diplomat sent to Georgia when it regained independence at the beginning of the 20th century. For me, it is important because of the chapter of the Tytus Filipowicz, to which I belong. It was established in 2018, on the 100th anniversary of Poland and Georgia regaining independence. This award is aimed at honoring the merits of the citizens of Caucasian countries in the development of science, culture and public life, in shaping and developing civil society in the Caucasus and building democracy.
                      <p></p><b>G</b> – like Gaumarjos. This is the most common word in Georgia. Every tourist must know it. It is said with every toast. Gaumarjos Saqartvelo - "Long live Georgia". And a toast is a sacred thing for them. It is a tradition of meetings and feasts, during which we have the second key word for the Georgians - Tamada. This is the person who hosts the meeting at the table. It is she who leads the feast. The first toast is always for God, then for the family, host, children, friends, the reason for the meeting, in total there can be a lot of such toasts.
                      <p></p><b>H</b> – like hinkali, sometimes spelled khinkali. These are the famous Georgian dumplings-pouches. The classic ones are with meat. The portions are always huge. They are second only to khachapuri, or the famous Georgian bread, or, as some prefer - pancakes.
                      <p></p><b>H</b> – like history.No matter where you begin to dig, you will most likely find archaeological traces dating back centuries. Most of the remarkable monuments are on the UNESCO list. Gonio Fortress - Roman fortification. The oldest records relating to this place are in Pliny Secundus (first century AD). In the 2nd century it was a well-fortified Roman city of the then Colchis colony. Grakliani Gora - Archaeological site on a hill near Kaspi, where numerous artifacts from the Stone Age to Antiquity have been discovered. Gremi - founded by King Levan, in the 16th and 17th centuries it was the capital of the kingdom of Kakheti. The ruins of the city cover about 50 ha. On the hill there is an Orthodox church of the Holy Archangels, a castle tower, a bell tower and a wine cellar. In Kutaisi there is Bagrata Cathedral - from the 11th century. It was built in the "golden age" of Georgian culture and statehood. She was a symbol of the country's political power and national unity. Uplisciche - ancient rock town, about 10 km east of Gori town. This is one of the oldest settlements, and its origins date back to the 5th century BC. Vardzia - an amazing rock city-monastery on the slope of Mount Eruszeli. Its construction began during the reign of George III in 1185, and was completed - under the rule of his daughter, King Tamara. Vardzia served as a shelter during the Mongol invasions; it could accommodate up to 60 thousand. people. There was a monastery, a throne room, and over 3,000 chambers on 13 floors. A complicated irrigation system for nearby farmlands has been installed in the city.
                      <p></p><b>I</b> – like Ijaw na-na. This is a very famous Georgian lullaby. Every mom sings it to her baby. Or I - like Ilya Chavchavadze, a Georgian writer and social activist. He died as a result of an attack. He is widely regarded as a national hero and father of modern Georgia.
                      <p></p><b>J</b> – it is not in the Georgian alphabet, but it can be - Prometheus cave, considered one of the most beautiful in the world. The total length of the cave is approx. 11 km, 1060 m of which are open to tourists. It was discovered in the 1980s, but it became an attraction thanks to Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, who in 2010 proposed its name in honor of the mythical Prometheus who was chained to a rock in this area. It is also worth remembering from mythology that, according to ancient Greek legend, the Argonauts under the command of Jason went to the Kingdom of Colchis (now Western Georgia) to get the golden fleece belonging to the locals, and gold can still be found in Georgia today.
                      <p></p><b>K</b> – like Kartveli, because that's how Georgians are called, because the language does not have any pronouns and it does not distinguish between kinds. In general, Georgia is not Georgia for the Georgians themselves, because they call their country Saqartvelo, which means the country of the Kartli. Young people would probably say K for Katie Melua, she is also very well-known in Poland, born in Kutaisi, Georgian-British singer. The list of famous Georgians also includes Kacha Kaladze, a respected AC Milan player and currently the mayor of Tbilisi. But the most famous is still Stalin, or rather Joseph Dzugashvili. Many would prefer to forget about him, but he also has his supporters. And in his hometown of Gori, he has a museum. The second famous Georgian from the time of the USSR is Lavrenty Beria, the head of the NKVD.
                      <p></p><b>L</b> – like lari, or Georgian currency, divided into 100 tetri. In Old Georgian, the word "lari" means "treasure". Interestingly, the lari banknotes are produced by the Polish Security Printing Works. 1 lari (GEL) is 1.30 Polish zloty (PLN).
                      <p></p><b>Ł</b> – it is not in the Georgian alphabet, but for me it is a bathhouse, or rather a bath. It's a Turkish bath that the Persians built here centuries ago. Today baths are everywhere, and Georgians especially love the sulfur ones. It is said that the bathhouse is the best bath ever.
                      <p></p><b>M</b> – like mamuli, or homeland. It could be m - like mom, but with them mom is deda, but dad is mom. For Georgians, three things are most important in the world: sarcmunoeba (Christian faith), mamuli (motherland) and ena (Georgian language). M can also be like mandarin, because some believe that this is where the best mandarins in the world mature. The film "Mandarins" by Zaza Urushadze is also famous.
                      <p></p><b>N</b> – like Natakhtari. This is a village close to Tbilisi famous for its water. So there is Natachtari lemonade, beer and a brewery.
                      <p></p><b>O</b> – like Omalo, the highest situated village in Europe. To get to it, you have to overcome one of the most dangerous roads in the world, winding among the mountains and full of precipices. It is also the highest road in the Caucasus, and the Abano Pass (2,850 m above sea level) is its highest point. Those who rode it say that the landscape around it looks as if you were flying by plane.
                      <p></p><b>P</b> – like a friend and Poland. For them, we are a country in Europe with which they feel very closely connected. Poland was the first country to recognize Georgia's independence in 1919. In the Second Polish Republic, a group of Georgian officers was admitted to serve in the Polish army. In turn, the Georgian Polonia is one of the oldest in the region - its representatives settled from the end of the 18th century, after the Kościuszko Uprising. After the 19th-century uprisings, some Polish exiles managed to avoid deportation to Kazakhstan or Siberia and end up in Georgia. It is estimated that in the second half of the nineteenth century, about 10 percent. of Tbilisi residents are our fellow countrymen. They are remembered to this day, they were educated people and influenced the city's development. They say that a Pole and a Georgian share similar characteristics: we are hospitable, we have a common history and a common enemy. They remind that from 1801 Russia ruled their country with a hard hand for almost 200 years. In addition, there was also the war that Russia waged against Georgia in the summer of 2008. They emphasize that Poland currently supports them politically. They remember about Lech Kaczyński. They say we are their ambassador on the way to the European Union and NATO.
                      <p></p><b>Q</b> – like qvevri. It is a traditional vessel in which wine is stored and buried in the ground. To this day, ancient qvevri with the remains of wine are excavated in Georgia.
                      <p></p><b>R</b> – like Rustaveli Shot, he is a 12th century Georgian poet. It means to them as much as Adam Mickiewicz to us. Rustaveli is the author of the epic poem "Knight in tiger skin", the Georgian national epic. To this day, it remains an undisputed masterpiece and is the only literary work written in Georgian that is known all over the world.
                      <p></p><b>S</b> – like Saqartvelo, or Georgia. They really want to call their country that. In 2011, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia made efforts to ensure that countries with which Georgians have friendly relations use the new name of this country - Saqartvelo. Lithuania was one of the first countries to say it would do so. The word "Kartweli" comes from the mythical Kartlos - the progenitor of the Georgian nation. The origin of the term Georgia probably comes from the Proto-Indo-European word for mountains or the Persian word gorg - "wolf", but there is also Turkish "gurza", Arabic "gourd" or Persian "gordji" which translates as "fighting force against Islam." On the other hand, in the languages ​​of Western Europe, names for which the Greek georgian "agriculture" was the prototype are popular; and St. Jerzy - the patron of the country whose name refers to the Greek Geôrgios, Georgian - Giorgi, Russian - Georgy. One thing is certain, in the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, 2 states were established in Georgia: Kolchida and Iberia. On the other hand, the sources of the Georgian nation and state go deep into antiquity and Georgia is considered to be a contemporary of ancient Greece and Rome.
                      <p></p><b>T</b> – like Tamara, a comprehensively educated and beautiful king who brought Georgia the "golden age". She ruled a united Georgia from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea and it was during her reign in the 12th century when Georgia was the strongest country in the whole Caucasus. She was considered a saint by Catholics and Orthodox Christians. Her countrymen surround her with such great respect that a toast to a woman who has a lot of wisdom and love in her begins with King Tamara.
                      <p></p><b>U</b> – like vacation and holidays. When I went to Georgia for the first time, the country charmed me. This is an amazing corner of the world. The incredible diversity of the landscape, interesting monuments, ancient culture and original folklore make you want to go back there. Tourists can count on extraordinary hospitality, because Georgians believe that every guest is sent by God, and therefore they welcome all visitors in accordance with the principle "bread and cheese, heart and soul", they will gladly let you stay overnight, show the way or invite you to a traditional feast - supra. It is worth going there in winter for skiing, in summer to the Black Sea Riviera. We have an air connection from Wrocław to Kutaisi, where the flight time is less than 3.5 hours. There are also flights from Katowice, Kraków, Gdańsk and Warsaw. Georgia and the Caucasus can be an alternative to the Alps, especially as they have five-thousanders. It is definitely cheaper, even five times compared to the offer in Europe. The standards are good: I drove there, checked and left satisfied.Batumi needs no introduction on the Georgian Riviera. Annually, 9 million tourists visit this country with a population of 4 million. Poles are the most numerous group from the European Union. For Poles, Georgia is attractive because of its prices. Holidays are cheaper there than at the Polish seaside in the season, by 15-20%, including flight.
                      <p></p><b>V</b> – like victoria,which means victory. Poles and Georgians are nations of the same values, we are united by the love of freedom and patriotism. Both of our countries had to fight for a long time for the right to self-determination and for our own statehood - and we succeeded.
                      <p></p><b>W</b> – like wine, and Georgians have mastered it for ... 8,000 years. They have five main wine regions, headed by Kakheti - this is Georgian Tuscany, where 70% of the wine grows. all grapes of Georgia. There are over 500 grape varieties there. The strains of these grapes are endemic, so they do not occur anywhere in the world outside Georgia. The two most important ones are Rkatsiteli (white) and Saperavi (red). Georgians love wine - even the tombstones feature grapevine motifs and apparently the letters of the alphabet also refer to the shape of the grapevine.
                      <p></p><b>X i Y</b>  – is not in the Georgian alphabet
                      <p></p><b>Z</b> – like Gamsakhurdia’s Scout, a somewhat forgotten dissident and politician. When Mikhail Gorbachev initiated his policy of glasnost, Gamsakhurdia and Merab Kostava were leaders of the Georgian anti-Soviet opposition. In 1991, Scout Gamsakhurdia became the first president of the free Georgia. He aimed at the complete independence of his country from Russia.

                      <p>Wrocław is the first Polish city where a Georgian consulate was established. It is no accident that the capital of Lower Silesia and the region have had friendly 
                        contacts with Georgia for many years. I really wanted Wrocław and Batumi to be partner cities, and I succeeded. 
                        On July 17, 2019, at the Alphabetic Tower in Batumi, the President of Wrocław Jacek Sutryk and the President of Batumi Lasha Komakhidze signed an agreement.

                      <p>There is a legend associated with the creation of Georgia that Georgians are happy to share:</p>

                      <p>„God, after He created the world, gathered all the nations and declared that He would justly divide the Earth and that every nation would get its place on it. 
                        At a time when all the nations in the queue were waiting for the best piece of Earth, the Georgians decided to devote themselves to fun, feasting in honor of the Creator. 
                        When they realized that God had already divided all the earth, they humbly told their Creator that they were drinking wine and feasting in His honor. 
                        God thought about it and said: I have already divided the whole Earth - but after a moment's thought he added - but I decided to keep the most beautiful corner for myself.
                        Let it become your home, live in it as happily as you have lived until now.”. </p>

                      <p><b>Homo erectus was in Georgia</b></p>

                      <p>It is assumed that in the area of today's Georgia, homo erectus (the ancestor of modern man) appeared 1.8-1.6 million years ago. 
                        The first state organisms (Diaohi and Kolcha) arose from the 12th to the 7th century BCE. 
                        In the 4th century BC the Kingdom of Iberia was established - in today's areas of East Georgia.</p>

                      <p><b>Under foreign rule</b></p>

                      <p>Over the centuries, the peoples of today's Georgia have struggled with many invasions on the areas they inhabit, 
                        and the state organisms arising there had to repeatedly struggle with the imposed sovereignty. 
                        The most difficult periods include: Arab rule, Mongol invasions, and wars between Turkey and Persia over the division of the Caucasus.</p>
                      
                      <p><b>Golden Age and reunification</b></p>

                      <p>The golden age of development of the already unified Georgian state falls on the 11th and 12th centuries. 
                        Later rapprochement with the Russian Empire took place, which was officially approved by the Georgiyev Treaty. 
                        The nineteenth century was another for Georgia when the state had to submit to foreign sovereignty as the Russian Empire absorbed Georgia.</p>
                      
                      <p><b>Regain independence</b></p>

                      <p>Georgia regained its independence in 1918. It did not last long, because in 1921 the country was incorporated into the USSR. 
                        Georgia regained independence in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The first president of Georgia was Zviad Gamsakhurdia.</p>

                      <p>2008 for Georgia is also the year in which Georgians had to defend themselves against the aggressor. 
                        On August 8, a five-day war in which the Russian Federation became involved began.</p>

                      <p>Thanks to the strong reaction of world opinion initiated by the then President of Poland, Lech Kaczyński, the Russian Federation did not go any further. 
                        However, the Georgians failed to gain control of the lost lands, and therefore Abkhazia and South Ossetia are currently outside Tbilisi's control, 
                        and 20% of Georgia is still occupied by the Russian Federation.</p>
